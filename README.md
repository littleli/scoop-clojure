# scoop-clojure

This is a new and convenient way to install Clojure on Windows.

- [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) is not required
- Administrator privileges are not required
- High chance it works in corporate Windows systems

First install Scoop installer. Installation steps for scoop and additional information can be found [here](http://scoop.sh). Don't worry installation is easy.

To install Clojure with Scoop you have to add two important buckets first:

```sh
# if you don't have git version control system installed
# it is required for adding new external buckets to your scoop installer
# you can skip this step otherwise
scoop install git

# add scoop bucket for Java 
scoop bucket add java

# add scoop bucket for clojure build
scoop bucket add scoop-clojure https://github.com/littleli/scoop-clojure
```

Now we are ready to install Java and Clojure by issuing following commands:

```sh
# install Java runtime and compiler
scoop install adoptopenjdk-lts-hotspot

# install official clojure tools
scoop install clojure

# update to the newest version
scoop update clojure
```

After successfully running steps above, you should be able to run Clojure with following:

```sh
clj
```

To launch clojure from `cmd.exe` or tools like Emacs, you can use prepared shims:

```sh
cmd-clj
cmd-clojure
```
